rubyfx
======

Lightweight library for creating JavaFX applications in JRuby with FXML support brought to you by [splatfx](https://github.com/jbreeden/splatfx).

Documentation
-------------

Never coming... I've given up on JavaFX in favor of wxWidgets for my GUI needs. If you'd like, you can check out the [RubyFx_SequelPad](https://github.com/jbreeden/RubyFx_SequelPad) demo for a sample of how to use this library. The source code itself is rather short, since splatfx is doing most of the work, and it should be easy to get a feel for things with a quick glance through. If, on the other hand, you're interested in seeing an example of embedding MRI into a wxWidgets application, check out [SequelPad](https://github.com/jbreeden/SequelPad).
