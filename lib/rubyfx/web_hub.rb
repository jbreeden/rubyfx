module RubyFx
  
  # Called to create a pair of web hubs, allowing simple asynchronous
  # communication between a JRuby "server" object and the JavaScript in a WebView.
  # The method accepts
  # - server: The Ruby object to which all events from the WebClientHub will be dispatched (as method calls)
  # - web_view: The WebView to inject the WebClientHub into
  # - hub_name: The name of the global object in the JavaScript context to which method calls from the WebServerHub
  #             will be dispatched. This object will also receive a field, `hub_name.server` on which the client triggers
  #             events, ex: `hub_name.server.emit('event_name', {event: 'argument_object'})`

  # This is used to ensure the WebClientHub is injected into the WebView
  # after the page has loaded. That way, the client has an opportunity to 
  # configure the hub receiver before we attempt to bind to it.
